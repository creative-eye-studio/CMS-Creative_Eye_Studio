Tagging and Branching system explanation
========================================

# Tags

We provide tags as best as we can, to be used proficiently with composer or deps.

The development of this bundle is intended for Symfony >= 2.0.*; here is a brief explanation of the tagging system we use:

- tags with the __"X.Y"__ format are compatible with the latest version of Symfony
- tags with the __"S2.0/X.Y"__ format are compatible with Symfony 2.0.*
- tags with the __"S2.1/X.Y"__ format are compatible with Symfony 2.1.*

# Branches

Currently there are 3 main branches:

- __master__: compatible with the latest version of Symfony
- __symfony-2.1.x__: compatible with Symfony 2.1.*
- __symfony-2.0.x__: compatible with Symfony 2.0.*
